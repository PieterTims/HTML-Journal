      <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
      <h6>and this is heading 6</h6>

      <p>
        &lt;br&gt; can be used to do a line <br />
        break. While &lt;hr&gt; can be used to add a horizontal line.
      </p>

      <hr style="width: 50%" />

      <p>
        &lt;br&gt; and &lt;hr&gt; can be further defined by doing &lt;br/hr
        style=" (add style here)"&gt;. &lt;p&gt; is used to make new paragraphs.
        &lt;em&gt; is used to <em>emphasize</em> a part of the text. It is
        highly advised to use this instead on &lt;i&gt;. Same advise goes for
        &lt;strong&gt; to <strong>bold</strong> a part of a text (&lt;b&gt;
        being the alternative to it). I assume that this is because it is much
        easier to style it later using CSS.

      <ul>

          <li>This also uses &lt;li&gt; to populate it.</li>

            As shown, you can nest this inside an unordered list,

            </ul>

          <li>
            Ordered list comes with different types:
            <ol type="A">
              <li>Capitalized alphabets</li>
            </ol>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>small alphabets</li>
            </ol>
            <ol type="I">
              <li>Capitalized roman numerals</li>
            </ol>
            <ol type="i">
              <li>small roman numerals</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Ordered list can also start from any number and can be reversed.
            <ol start="2" reversed>
              <li>This</li>
              <li>is</li>

        In the table of contents part of the page, there are links that, when
        clicked brings users to a different part of the page. this is done by
        using the &lt;a&gt; tag, then using an attribute called
        <strong>href</strong> to link to a different part of a page that has
        been named using <strong>id</strong> attribute. <strong>href</strong> is
        usually used to hyperlink to
        <a href="http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/cheatsheet.php" target="_blank">
          HTTP-based URLs</a
        >, <a href="assets/stranger-1.jpg" alt="Photo of a stranger">images</a>,

        CSS syntax looks like this = selector{property:value;} , it is possible
        to add multiple property:value (or rule) into one selector.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>selector</strong> is the "Who?" as in which tag is it pointing
          towards
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>property</strong> is the "What?" as in what property needs to
          be changed
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>value</strong> is the "How?" as in how do you want to change
          the property.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There is always a default css style that is applied to all tags, and
        when we write a css code corresponding to that default, it will override
        the default and use our code. The best practice to keep the multiple
        rules organised is to keep it in alphabetical order, which will make it
        easier to both read and debug.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are other kinds of selectors as well, namely <u>class</u> and
        <u>id</u> selectors. These can be used to differentiate similar tags so
        that it is possible to have the same tag used for different things
        having different set of rules (Example: &lt;img class="one"&gt; and
        &lt;img class="two"&gt; can be styled by different selectors).
      </p>

      <p><strong>class & id selectors have higher priority</strong>.</p>

      <p>
        ids can be used only once in each file, i.e. only one id called apple or
        only one id called carboard_box etc. , making it a super specific
        instance. One tag can have multiple classes embedded but only one id.
        CSS can be done in three different ways: Inline, Internal or External.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inline CSS applies style inside a tag by adding a style component inside
        the opening tag. Examples:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li style="background-color: blueviolet; margin: 10px">
          <span style="color: white">
            This one adds a bg color of blue violet and a margin of 10 pixels on
            the list while a &lt;span&gt; tag applies the color white to the
            text.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li
          style="
            list-style-type: georgian;
            background-color: violet;
            margin-right: 100px;
          "
        >
          <span>
            While this one changes the list-style-type to georgian with a bg
            color of violet, with margin-right set to 100px.
          </span>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Internal CSS applies style by using a &lt;style&gt; tag that resides in
        the &lt;head&gt; component. Each chapter resides in a &lt;div&gt; tag,
        and using the &lt;style&gt; tag, I added a different into chapter 2.
        Internal CSS applies to the whole page/html file.
      </p>
      <p>
        External CSS on the other hand can be implemented into multiple html
        files. The way external CSS works, is the same as Internal CSS. You
        create a CSS file the same way you make a html file. Then, you use
        &lt;link&gt; to link that CSS file to a HTML file. External CSS is
        usually recommended to implement all style to your whole website.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-block-end: 0em">
        *<strong>Priorities for CSS = Inline > Internal > External.</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Use the chrome dev tools to debug and change the the css part of the
          code easier. Right-clicking on a certain element and choosing inspect
          brings up the code for that exact element.
        </li>
        <li>
          Favicons can be linked using rel="icon", there usually more than one
          resolution that needs to be saved for these favicons. Android, Chrome,
          Opera and Apple all have their own size. favicons are used to make it
          easier for users to identify which website they are in just from a
          glance.
        </li>
        <li>
          &lt;div&gt; is used to defined a division or section of an HTML. This
          tag is a block-level organizing tool.
        </li>
        <li>
          &lt;span&gt; is used as an inline container to style a part of a text
          or document. This tag is an inline-level organizing tool.
        </li>
        <li>
          each element of an HTML has a default CSS style that is implemented by
          chrome. block-level elements have multiple display elements that can
          be manipulated. <em>content</em> sits inside a <em>padding</em> which
          sits inside a <em>border</em>, and there is a <em>margin</em> that sit
          outside of the border. for easier context:
          <p id="boxModelExample">This is its content.</p>
          Here, the text inside has been set to 10pt, with padding 10pt, border
          style: double with a width of 5 pt, and a margin of 1 inch.
        </li>
        <li>
          Display is one of the default CSS styles written to the tags, this
          specifies the display behavior of an element. There are 4 commonly
          used display properties. Block, Inline, Inline-block, and None.
          <ol>
            <li>
              Block is usually seen in &lt;p&gt; and &lt;h&gt;. This displays an
              element as a block element.It starts on a new line, and takes up
              the whole width
            </li>
            <li>
              Inline is usually seen in &lt;span&gt;,&lt;a&gt; and &lt;img&gt;.
              This displays an element as an inline element. Any height and
              width properties will have no effect
            </li>
            <li>
              Inline-block displays an element as an inline-level container, but
              you can add height and width properties to it.
            </li>
            <li>
              None just removes the element from displaying. There is a property
              called visibility that can be added to an element to hide it while
              still taking the space of the display it implements.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
