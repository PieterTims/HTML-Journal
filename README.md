Welcome!

This is a repo for my journal through learning web dev independently. It will be updated whenever I learn new concepts and try to implement it into one website hosted through github. Hopefully this website will be able to show my journey through learning both front-end and back-end parts of web development. My first goal in this study is to be able to create a uniquely designed portfolio website for my CV that will (hopefully) expand as I learn more stuff about being a full stack developer.
